## **What is LogicMed?**  
**LogicMed** is an AI-powered medical data management platform designed to transform **unstructured patient data** (prescriptions, lab reports, scans) into **structured, searchable insights**, empowering doctors and administrators to make faster, smarter decisions.  

---

## **Key Features**  
🔍 **AI-Driven Structuring**  
   - Converts free-text notes, handwritten prescriptions, and imaging reports into standardized, analyzable formats.  

⚡ **Real-Time Insights**  
   - Query patient records in natural language (e.g., *“Show diabetic patients with elevated HbA1c in Q2 2024”*).  

🧠 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   - Combines OpenAI’s intelligence with your hospital’s data for context-aware answers.  

🗃️ **Hybrid Storage**  
   - **MongoDB**: Stores metadata for quick access.  
   - **Vector Database**: Enables lightning-fast similarity searches (e.g., “Find patients with symptoms like this”).

## **How It Works**  
1. **Upload** unstructured data (PDFs, scans, text).  
2. **Extract** key details using NLP and ML models.  
3. **Structure** and link data to patient profiles.  
4. **Query** with AI to uncover trends, risks, and opportunities.
